# Highlight.js for Evolution

This simple WordPress plugin imports a custom build of the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) library, a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It was written to be useful on blog posts of [my website](https://matheusmisumoto.dev/).

For more information on highlight.js, please refer to its [documentation](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Languages

The custom build of highlight.js used in this repository supports the following syntaxes:

- accesslog
- bash
- cmake
- css
- dart
- dockerfile
- gradle
- haskell
- ini
- java
- javascript
- json
- kotlin
- makefile
- nginx
- php
- powershell
- properties
- shell
- sql
- swift
- typescript
- yaml

## Styling

The CSS is based on the `VS2015` highlight.js theme. It has some minor adjustments to adapt to the custom Evolution theme for WordPress used on my website.
